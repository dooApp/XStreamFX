XStreamFX is a collection of converters for XStream intended to handle JavaFX types (properties, observable collections,...).

How does it work?

The easiest way to use XStreamFX is to use the FXConverters class to configure your XStream instance:

XStream xStream = new XStream();
FXConverters.configure(xStream);
